Error summary: Something is drastically wrong for any error to occur so much!

Recurrences --  Description
        7 -- getatomic_data: line input incomplete: %s
        1 -- wind2d: Cell %3d (%2d,%2d) has %d corners in wind, but zero volume
        3 -- wind_div_v: div v %e is negative in cell %d. Major problem if inwind (%d) == 0
        9 -- disk_init: Got to ftot %e at r %e < rmax %e. OK if freqs are high
